### What doesn't work 
Currenlty the transciption can sometimes be a little fuzzy and mic sometimes picks up two pitches that are very close to each other when pressing a single key. I resolved this somewhat by associating two very similar pitches with one key, although more work needs to go into this to make it more stable. 

I only got to transcibing one flute scale and will be adding the logic for more in the future, as well as making the project more modular/easier to add intruments.
